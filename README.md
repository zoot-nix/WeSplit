## Description

#### SwiftUI Project:

weSplit is an check-splitting app that you might use after eating at a restaurant – you enter the cost of your food, select how much of a tip you want to leave, and how many people you’re with, and it will tell you how much each person needs to pay.

#### weSplit UI:
